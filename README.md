# VOT:ED


## Background
The US voter turnout ranks 31 out of 35 developed Countries. A recent study showed that 1 in 4 eligible voters had not even registered to vote. A common reason for that is because voters simply do not know who they are voting for and thus require research on the candidates.

Voter education means providing citizens of a democracy with basic information about participating in elections. Voter education is often provided by the state itself, often through a national electoral commission, so it is therefore important that it is politically non-partisan. Government departments that focus on voter education are often highly scrutinized by a third party.

## Overview
VOT:ED is a platform for voters to research and get educated on the upcoming Primary Election. We want to be a "one stop shop" for voters to research and get educated on all the candidates. Our aim is to be un-biased by providing news from all sources on the web.

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The backend was built using Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, and various APIs (NewsAPI & Twitter).
